        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p><strong>Melti began with a mother’s love — and grew into a mission.</strong></p>
        <p>My daughter is a model who adores desserts, yet her work often meant saying no to sweets. As a mother and a baker, I wanted her to enjoy the pleasure of dessert without the burden of guilt.</p>
        <p>That’s how Melti was born — with a promise: to make desserts that are as kind to the body as they are joyful to the heart.</p>
        <p>But this love didn’t stop at my daughter. I realized there are so many girls and women — just like her — who crave sweetness, beauty, and indulgence, but are held back by health concerns or fear of gaining weight.</p>
        <p>At Melti, every recipe is carefully crafted with reduced sugar, balanced ingredients, and a fresh, light texture — all without compromising on taste or elegance.</p>
        <p>Because we believe dessert should never be a source of stress. It should be a celebration — of beauty, of balance, and of joy.</p>
        <p><strong>Melti is where indulgence meets intention — and every bite melts with care.Welcome to Melti — let’s make life a little sweeter.</strong></p>
